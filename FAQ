### What is Project Licenser?

Project Licenser (www.projectlicenser.org) is a website that helps users
pick licenses for their projects based on their needs and preferences.

### Who created this project?

This project was created by and is stewarded by Rachel Michaela Bradley.
(https://www.delevingne.me/, contact@delevingne.me). She is the main
author and designated copyright holder.

### Is Project Licenser free software?

Yes. The software and content of Project Licenser are released under the
terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.0. You may
modify Project Licenser in accordance with those terms.

### Where is the project source hosted?

The project source can currently be found at the following URL.

https://www.github.com/rachelmichaela/project-licenser/

### What qualifies a license for inclusion in Project Licenser?

There is no set requirement for each license. There are also no explicit
requirements that would prevent inclusion; we do not limit the included
options to free software or free culture licenses, or to compatibility
with the GNU General Public License, for instance.

Instead, licenses are evaluated on their own merit and present use.
Examples of such criteria are as follows.

**Merit:**
- Licenses should be unique, or have a unique quality;
- Licenses should serve a particular purpose;
- Licenses should be legally adequate for encouraging their purpose;
- Licenses should not depend upon the existence of other licenses, nor
should the inclusion of a license require another, separate license be
included;
- Licenses should respect modesty.

**Present Use:** 
- Licenses should be used projects of note;
- Licenses should not be in the process of being phased out by their
authors or backing bodies;
- Licenses should not be declared legally void or unenforceable in the
jurisdiction of the countries that the author focuses their work
towards.

For example, the ISC License is included because it is used and
preferred by the OpenBSD team, who are responsible not only for their
operating system but also a wide array of associated products.

The "WTFPL" is not included because it is not modest (vulgarity), it
is not legally adequate (dangerously ambiguous and possibly satirical),
and it is not used by projects of note.

Generally speaking, we typically to include only the most recent version 
of a license (e.g. GNU GPL version 3.0, not version 2.0). There is no
particular bias against older versions in particular, and we may include
then at our discretion, but we generally follow the advice of the 
authors and backing bodies of a particular license as to what version
is preferred.

### My browser isn't included in the "no-script" instructions. Can you add it?

Possibly. Please open a ticket in the GitHub repository and provide
information about your browser.

The current list of browsers is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, and it is the
project author's intention that it should remain that way. Bear this in
mind when providing your suggestion.

### How do I contribute to Project Licenser?

Users are encouraged to contribute to the development of Project
Licenser. Below are some suggestions for prospective contributors.

**For Developers:** 
- Review CONDUCT before contributing.
- Review README and CHANGES to see what has already been implemented.
- Create an issue to discuss any proposed changes that you have.
- Create a pull request if the consensus is in favour of your proposed
changes, if said changes have not already been implemented.
- Ensure that you state that you are granting all intellectual property
rights to your contribution to the copyright holder of the project.

**For Other Users:**
- Review CONDUCT before contributing.
- Review CHANGES to see what has already been implemented.
- View DIAGRAM.PNG to see how the programme currently casts decisions.
- Create an issue to discuss any proposed changes that you have.
- If your change is approved, a developer will implement it and your 
issue will be closed when it is complete.
- Ensure that you state that you are granting all intellectual property
rights to your contribution to the copyright holder of the project.

The inclusion of contributions within the project is currently at the
discretion of the project author.

### Can you give me a technical explanation of how the project works?

Sure. Project Licenser is an event-driven JavaScript application, 
programmed without libraries or external dependencies. It works by
displaying questions to the user, which the user then responds to by
selecting either a positive or a negative response. 

This response is then interpreted, and the programme then follows the 
decision tree represented by DIAGRAMME.PNG. As it progresses through the
tree, it weights appropriate items within the arrays of licenses to 
reflect the growing value of a particular license. Once the tree reaches
a terminal point, it displays the license with the most weight.

The data shown to users once a terminal point has been reached is stored
in a JSON file within the project's root directory. This JSON file can
be updated separately to the main JavaScript file.

### Why do you require contributors to grant copyright to the author?

Many software projects, especially large free software projects, require
contributors to relinquish all of the copyright and intellectual 
property rights to the controller of the project. For example, 
contributors to the GNU project are asked to assign all rights to the
Free Software Foundation.

There are a myriad of reasons as to why this is important, but here is
a quick summary of the two major points.

- By having a single copyright holder that owns all of a project's
source, that copyright holder can take legal responsibility for the 
entire source. This allows them to pursue legal action, such as license
enforcement, on behalf of all project contributors. This helps defend
software rights.
- Should relicensing be required in the future, such as migrating to a
new version of the GNU AGPL, the copyright holder can act upon their
own discretion. If contributors do not assign their rights to the 
copyright holder, then the copyright holder must consult each individual
contributor, and then recreate all functionality implemented by each
contributor that does not consent to the license change.

### My question isn't answered here.

I'm sorry to hear that. I recommend opening an issue on the GitHub
repository. We will be able to answer your question there, and if we
think the issue that you raise should be included here, it will for
future releases.
