### About Project Licenser

Project Licenser was started in 2020 (5781) by software engineer 
<a href="https://www.delevingne.me">Rachel Michaela Bradley</a>. 
Frustrated by both the lack of functionality and the complexity of other
websites that provide software and cultural licensing recommendations, 
she set about creating a foolproof tool to provide recommendations from 
a curated and modest array of licenses.
